## Notes

As for now, I have not yet validated this module with the course's faculty.
However, it has been a week since I finished Tutorial 1a and made a request for validation -- and I have not gotten a response in the group chat --
Hence, I am submitting this today so I would be able to move on to the next tutorial.
Thank you in advance.
